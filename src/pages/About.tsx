          I am a 39-
          year-old guy with a diverse background in the industrial sector,
          holding roles such as process operator, QA administrator, laboratory
          technician, and team lead. In my mid-30s, I decided to transition to
          follow my passion: frontend development. Over the last 4 years, I've
          fully dedicated myself to mastering this craft.
          I have always been interested in technology in general, and web
          design in particular. Since I began my education in Front End
          development at EC in Helsingborg, I have been driven by curiosity
          and a desire to learn, both inside and outside of the class room.
          Today I’
          m working full time as a frontend developer for a planner
          tool used within the IKEA website. In my day to day work I build and
          style components within react, write tests with jest and sometimes
          in cypress and handle backend logic and data flows in AWS using
          serverless framework. I work in an agile team using scrum
          principles.
          In my professional role I’
          m always striving to learn, understand and
          master new technologies and concepts. I never shy away from a
          tough problem but embrace it as an opportunity for professional as
          well as personal growth.
          The personal qualities that best describe me are humility, curiosity,
          focus and drive. Furthermore, I believe I have an eye for design, even
          though I'm not classically trained in it.
          Outside of work I am a husband, a father of 3 and an owner of 3 pets
          (2 dogs and a cat), the family life takes up most of my free time.
          When time finds me, I like to hit up the gym, go cykling or cook,
          preferably something from the asian or Mexican kitchen. I also read
          a lot of books, most of them about coding
